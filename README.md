# About Me

I've always been interested in how computing can serve human endeavor. My academic background is evolutionary biology, well served by computational methods.

I currently work at Sema4 on the production bioinformatics team. There I help author, run, and maintain HIPAA-compliant cloud-native DNA sequence analysis pipelines and related infrastructure. I also lend my bioinformatics expertise to software developers and engineers from whom I get to learn the latest and best CI/CD and AWS practices.

Previously I worked at the [Yale Center for Research Computing](https://research.computing.yale.edu/) (YCRC). There I helped researchers accelerate their computational work, often on Yale's [high performance computing infrastructure](https://docs.ycrc.yale.edu/clusters-at-yale/clusters/). To this end, I consulted with researchers one-on-one, adapted and designed [short workshops](https://research.computing.yale.edu/training), and contributed to the YCRC [docs](https://github.com/ycrc/ycrc.github.io/tree/src) and [tools](https://github.com/ycrc). At Yale I had the pleasure of collaborating on a diverse set of projects. They ranged from supporting a digital classroom environment for [YData123](http://ydata123.org/) to working in [Casey Dunn's lab](http://dunnlab.org/) on an [IoT equipment monitoring project](https://github.com/dunnlab/lullaby) and a [phlogenetics manuscript](https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msab170).

[Here is my CV](CV_Benjamin_Robert_Evans.pdf).
