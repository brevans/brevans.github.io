# About Me

I've always been interested in how computing can serve human endeavor. My educational background is in evolutionary biology, well served by computational methods. I currently work at the [Yale Center for Research Computing](https://research.computing.yale.edu/) (YCRC). There I help researchers get their work done faster with computers, often on Yale's [high performance computing infrastructure](https://docs.ycrc.yale.edu/clusters-at-yale/clusters/). To this end, I [consult with researchers](https://docs.ycrc.yale.edu/#in-person-support) one-on-one, adapt and design [short workshops](https://research.computing.yale.edu/training), and contribute to the YCRC [docs](https://github.com/ycrc/ycrc.github.io/tree/src) and [tools](https://github.com/ycrc). At Yale I have the pleasure of working on many miscellaneous projects, such as the digital classroom environment for [YData123](http://ydata123.org/). I also currently spend 20% of my time working embedded in [Casey Dunn's lab](http://dunnlab.org/).
